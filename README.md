- Collaborated with a team of four from Miranda House to develop a ball-balancing platform with a maze, enabling the ball to navigate through the maze.
- Created a 3D maze in CoppeliaSim using image processing with OpenCV in Python and Lua programming, and developed a physically stable platform to support the maze.
- Gained practical experience in image processing, control systems, 3D design, algorithm development, Lua programming, and robotics simulation. Despite challenges with the ball-balancing algorithm, the project enhanced problem-solving and teamwork skills.
